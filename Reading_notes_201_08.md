# Day(8)
### In this reading note we will sammary the capter (15) from duckeet book.
* In this chaptar we can make our pages more organaized and do some style on it by add background image or change font size, color,shape.
* we can use relative positioning to moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow by using this code:
 p.example {
position: relative;
top: 10px;
left: 100px;}
* How do you think we can put the heading in the top or bottom or lift or right on the secreen?
> You can do this by using (position: absolute) also you change the width of it.
* When you use relative, fixed, or absolute positioning, boxes can overlap. If boxes do overlap, the elements that appear later in the HTML code sit on top of those that are earlier in the page. If you control this you cann use a (z-index) 
* Do you want to put paragraphs side by side if want that you need to use floot and if you do that remember to define width and hight.
> Also you can insert multi column using floot.
* The most important thing is to use the page size and define it.
