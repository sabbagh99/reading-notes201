1. The past of local storage for web application.
* In the first the user when he want to use internet he only have the  Internet Explorer to reach that,  Internet Explorer. One of these things was called DHTML Behaviors, and one of these behaviors was called userData.
* UserData allows web pages to store up to 64 KB of data per domain.but In 2002, Adobe introduced a feature in Flash 6 that gained the unfortunate and misleading name of “Flash cookies.” Within the Flash environment, this allow to store up to 100 KB of data per domain.

* In 2007, Google launched Gears, an open source browser plugin aimed at providing additional capabilities in browsers. Gears provides an API to an embedded SQL database based on SQLite. After obtaining permission from the user once, Gears can store unlimited amounts of data per domain in SQL database tables.

* HTML5 storage : what is the mean and how its work? you can say  is a specification named Web Storage, which was at one time part of the HTML5 specification proper, but was split out into its own specification for uninteresting political reasons. Certain browser vendors also refer to it as “Local Storage” or “DOM Storage.”
