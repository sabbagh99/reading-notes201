1. CSS Transforms : in this arrical we hane to many proparty we can use them in CSS like :
*  2D Rotate : The rotate value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees. 

* 2D Scale: The scale value within the transform property allows you to change the appeared size of an element.

* 2D Translate: The translate value works a bit like that of relative positioning, pushing and pulling an element in different directions without interrupting the normal flow of the document. 

>And to many we cant mention them all but for all transform the actual syntax for the transform property is quite simple, including the transform property followed by the value. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses.

2. Transitions & Animations : With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.

Animations within CSS3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes. Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.
 
 So the benfet from  of CSS3 that we can do too many thing using animation without use JavaScript or flash player.
