â€¢ Chapter 16: This chapter talking about image in CSS and how we can make our pages beautiful by using images but we must know how to use it.
1. when you add a image in your page its add in the default size for this page if you want to change this size,  can you do that ? if you can how . 
so to change your image size you should follow this steps :

> After you add your image inside your image tag you need to define width and height then change them as you want.

2. Can we use image and paragraph in the same section for example the paragraph on the left side and the image in the right side ? 

>Yes we can by using align , and you can do that in CSS by use align left or right as you want . Also you can use align center to let the page in the center.

3.How we can change our background image there is a proparaty in CSS its (background-image), and we have background-repeat proparaty and its have four values:

**background-repeat:** The background image is repeated both horizontallyand vertically.

**background-repeat-x:** The image is repeated horizontally only.

**background-repeat-y:** The image is repeated vertically only.

**background-no-repeat:** The image is only shown once.

4.Now after we have this proparaty we have important proparaty calld background-position this proparaty we use it to change image position  using one of this value (left top/left center/left bottom/center top/ center center/center bottom/right top/right center/right bottom)
